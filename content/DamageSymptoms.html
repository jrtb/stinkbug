      <p align="left" class="style1">Stink bugs damage small to medium-sized cotton bolls. Feeding damage introduces hard lock and boll rot pathogens into the boll, causing spotting and &ldquo;warts&rdquo; on the inner boll wall surface. A wart is the callous growth response to stink bug feeding. This initial damage often takes place within the first 24-48 hours after feeding. Subsequently, the new white developing lint may first turn yellow, then brownish in the area of the feeding site, or even throughout the boll.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Early boll damage most closely associated with cotton yield and quality losses are stained lint and internal boll warts. If a boll has either type of damage, however small, that boll is counted as damaged. External boll feeding spots caused by stink bugs and the tiny &ldquo;pin prick&rdquo; dark spot symptoms on the inner boll wall surface are not counted as an injured boll. Scouts should crush open and examine quarter-sized bolls (0.9 to 1.1 inches in diameter), looking for internal boll warts or stained lint.</p>
