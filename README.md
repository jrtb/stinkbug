app title:
Stink Bug Decision Aid App

description:
The Stink Bug Decision Aid App is a tool to help you decide the most economical time to manage stink bugs. It combines knowledge from eight years of research across five Southeastern US states and 58 trial locations. Features include high-resolution photographs of live adult and nymph stage insects to determine species and what constitutes stink bug injury to bolls, descriptions of how to scout, a boll sizer that can be used with your phone in the field, a decision aid card that can be printed and constructed for use in the field, an interactive dynamic threshold calculator, and a method to take photos of insects and damage that you can send from your phone in the field. The decision aid field card and dynamic threshold approach have been widely adopted throughout the US cotton belt.
